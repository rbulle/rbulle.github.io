<h2> Hi! I'm Rapha√´l, </h2>
I am a post-doc researcher at <a href="https://www.giref.ulaval.ca/" target=_blank>GIREF</a> in <a href="https://www.ulaval.ca/" target=_blank>Laval University</a>, Qu√©bec, QC, Canada. üçÅ<br />

My current work focuses on <b> gradient reconstructions </b> in the context of multimaterial <b> finite element </b> simulations, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.michelin.com/" target=_blank>Michelin</a>.<br />
<br />

My main research area of interest is <b>a posteriori error estimation</b> for finite element discretization. During my PhD I have worked on <b>hierarchical estimators</b> of Bank-Weiser type. I am especially interested in the design of efficient adaptive methods based on error estimation for the discretization of <b>linear fractional PDEs</b>.
