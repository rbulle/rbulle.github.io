<h2> Hi! I'm Raphaël, </h2>
I am a post-doc researcher at <a href="https://www.giref.ulaval.ca/" target=_blank>GIREF</a> in <a href="https://www.ulaval.ca/" target=_blank>Laval University</a>, Québec, QC, Canada.<br />
<br />

My current work focuses on <b> gradient reconstructions </b> in the context of multimaterial <b> finite element </b> simulations, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.michelin.com/" target=_blank>Michelin</a>.<br />
<br />

I am particularly interested in the <b> error estimation </b> of finite element discretization in various contexts including especially <b> linear fractional PDEs</b>.
